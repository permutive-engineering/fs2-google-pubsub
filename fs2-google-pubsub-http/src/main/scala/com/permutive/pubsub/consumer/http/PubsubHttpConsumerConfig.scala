/**
  * Configuration for the PubSub HTTP consumer.
  *
  * Note: It is up to the user to raise exceptions and terminate the lifecyle of services if this is desired when
  * retries are exhausted. Token refreshing runs on a background fiber so raising exceptions in
  * `onTokenRetriesExhausted` will have _no_ effect to the main fibers, in fact errors are swallowed entirely.
  *
  * @param host                              host of PubSub
  * @param port                              port of PubSub
  * @param isEmulator                        whether the target PubSub is an emulator or not
  * @param oauthTokenRefreshInterval         how often to refresh the Google OAuth token
  * @param onTokenRefreshSuccess             optional callback to execute when refreshing the token succeeds, errors are ignored
  * @param onTokenRefreshError               callback to execute if refreshing the token fails during retries, errors rethrown and retried
  * @param oauthTokenFailureRetryDelay       initial delay for retrying OAuth token retrieval
  * @param oauthTokenFailureRetryNextDelay   next delay for retrying OAuth token retrieval
  * @param oauthTokenFailureRetryMaxAttempts how many times to attempt; will raise the last error once reached
  * @param onTokenRetriesExhausted           callback to execute if refreshing the token exhausts retries.
  *                                          See note above on exceptions, up to the *user* to raise exceptions in their
  *                                          service using this callback if required.
  * @param acknowledgeBatchSize              maximum number of acknowledge messages to send in a single batch
  * @param acknowledgeBatchLatency           maximum time to wait before sending an acknowledge batch
  * @param readReturnImmediately             when polling for messages whether to return immediately if there are none or wait (can cause higher CPU use if `true`)
  * @param readMaxMessages                   how many messages to retrieve at once simultaneously
  * @param readConcurrency                   how much parallelism to use when fetching messages from PubSub
